# Portsmouth Shipping Movements

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/psidex/PortsmouthShippingMovements)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/psidex/PortsmouthShippingMovements)

This project was a website to show Portsmouth Harbours shipping movements.

Unfortunatley, on or around June 2021 the website `royalnavy.mod.uk` was put under Cloudflare protection which has made it very difficult to programatically scrape information from it.

Due to this I have taken the website for this project (psm.simonj.dev) offline and will not be working on this project for the forseeable future.

Previously the data was scraped every 6 hours from the links on the ["QHM Portsmouth" page](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/qhm/portsmouth/shipping-movements).

Here is what this projects website looked like:
